i am making an application that is meant to summarize voice notes,
using whisper turbo and an LLM. this is an application that we want
 to develop as a chrome web extension. User flow: 1. the user will 
 open WhatsApp web and then open our Chrome extension. There will 
 be a button "Select voice note". When the user clicks it, the 
 selection view will appear, highlighting possible voice notes detected 
 on the screen. and the user should be able to press esc to unhighlight 
 the voice notes. When the user selects the voice note, the extension 
 will download the audio to the downloads folder inside the extension. Then,
  it will ask to select language: Urdu or English. When the user 
  clicks the button, Then, the audio of that voice note will be sent 
  to our app, where it will be analyzed . WHile it is processing, 
  loading should be shown. And then both the transcription and the summary
   will be returned. and displayed in the chrome web extension popup.
    We will ensure user privacy by making sure that only those voice notes
     are sent to the server which the user voluntarily selects himself.
      We'll work on the actual summarization and transcription logic later. 
      this directory itself is the extension
